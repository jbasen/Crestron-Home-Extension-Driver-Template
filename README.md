# Crestron-Home-Extension-Driver-Template

These files make up a template I've created for writing extension drivers for Crestron Home.  Typically I include a zip file of my VS solution folder
so anyone can simply download the entire soluion and start using it.  However, because of the size of the solution folder for a Crestron Home project,
that isn't possible as the file is larger than allowed by Github.
